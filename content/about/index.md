My coding odyssey began in the corridors of academia, sparked during my days at [Manipal Academy of Higher Education](https://manipal.edu/mu.html) where I pursued a Master's in Embedded Systems (2020-2022). Graduating in October 2022 with a GPA of [8.68](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14YozhGjBTYs5P7ult6F1aPqRERS-ZHzj/view?usp=sharing), I delved into the intricacies of cutting-edge technology.

This educational voyage follows my successful completion of a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communications (2016-2020) from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/en/), marking the culmination of my undergraduate journey in October 2020.

I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Embitel Technologies (I) Pvt. Ltd., for 15 Months as a Full-Stack Developer.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
