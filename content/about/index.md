Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [PES University, Bangalore](https://pes.edu/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science (2015-2019) with a GPA of [3.74](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YteAN9IXtsFB5cWnINOAb4W5Gg2BA5ep/view?usp=sharing).

I'm a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/).

I have worked as a Software Engineer at Aruba Networks for 3 years as a full-stack developer.

I have been awarded as Aruba Recognition award multiple times by Aruba.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
