I graduated with a Master's in Embedded Systems from [Manipal Academy of Higher Education](https://manipal.edu/mu.html), my journey spans Full-Stack Development, from mastering [Java](#), [RDBMS](#), [SQL/NoSQL](#) databases software systems, [JSP](#), [Servlets](#), [Spring-MVC](#), to navigating the Cloud with [AWS](#).

Beyond the keyboard, you might catch me sketching tactical strategies for my clan [#98R99QYQJ](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/), because every good coder needs a side gig battling barbarians!
